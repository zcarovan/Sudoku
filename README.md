# Sudoku Solver

Created for Data Structures assignment in Spring 2020. All files/functions written in full by me unless otherwise specified as starter code from professor.

At the sudoku directory location, run these two commands in terminal:

```
makefile
./sudoku
```

Makefile makes an executable called sudoku, then ./sudoku executes said executable. 

Now, input the rows of your unsolved sudoku puzzle as strings separated by commas. The "_" character represents an empty space. For example, here is a correctly formatted array:

```
“___578492”, “___134768”, “___629531”, “263415987”, “974863125”, “851792643”, “138947256”, “692351874”, “745286319”
```

The program will then output the solved sudoku puzzle.
