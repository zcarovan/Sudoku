# Sudoku Solver

Created for Data Structures assignment in Spring 2020. All files written in full by me excluding starter code given by professor in stack.cc

At sudoku directory, run these commands in terminal:

```
makefile
./sudoku
```

Makefile makes an executable called sudoku, then ./sudoku executes the made executable. 

Now, input the sudoku array you want to solve. For example,

```
[“_________”, “_________”, “_________”, “_________”, “_________”, “_________”, “_________”, “_________”, “_________”]
```
